                                all started when I got into my 30s and started noticing some fine lines on my face,
                                while my facial contour became a little bit swollen. It seemed that I still looked
                                great, but I got that feeling that I was aging badly. Moreover, I noticed that my
                                husband began to stare at younger women, that he started cominghome later than usual and
                                preferred spending the weekendssomewhere away from home
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But that's not the half of it. After graduating from the university, I immediately got a
                                job as a lawyer at a large holding company. When I was 35, the head of our legal
                                department was going to retire and I was going to take over his job. I had all these
                                degrees, certificates, personal achievements, vast experience in the company, but...The
                                position went to a young wench with no experience and achievements, but having apretty
                                face.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                So, I started looking for ways to renew youth. I wanted to know how to get rid of these
                                eye bags, dark circles and crow's-feet and, of course, I wanted to find out how much it
                                would cost. My friends advised lifting or facelift, but:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Firstly, it is anything, but cheap, even for me.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Secondly, it could certainly be a kind of promising investments, but I think that in
                                    my case they are not very profitable, because of the long recovery period.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                I started visiting beauty shops, buying expensive cosmetics, taking face massages and
                                using various cosmetic oils - but when looking in the mirror, I still couldn’t see those
                                changes that I wanted to see. It seems like all these expensive beauty products aregood
                                for everyday care andage-gprevention, but they can do nothing about theexisting signs of
                                aging.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                While I was trying to regain my youth, my husband quit spending nights at home at all!
                                Business trips, meetings and other fake excuses…It was obvious that he just didn’t want
                                to come home, that he was not interested in me as in a woman anymore. I was afraid of
                                sinking into depression, which could repel my husband even more. And for another thing,
                                it was difficult to expect that my unstable emotional state could have some positive
                                effect on my expertise of a lawyer. You need a cool head and a sober mind to do the job.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                And then I decided to turn to the following folk remedies:

                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>In the mornings, I washed my face with ice-cubes of green tea. This procedure is
                                    intended to unwrinkle crow's-feet and to tighten skin on the eyelids.
                                </li>
                                <li>In the evenings, I applied eye lotions with linden leaf and flower tincture to
                                    remove swelling, panda eyes and heavy eyelids.
                                </li>
                                <li>At weekends, I applied honeymoon masks.</li>
                                <li>And I took a contrast shower 2 times a day. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Also, I started eating healthy:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I ate grated carrot and drank carrot juice at least 3-4 times a week.</li>
                                <li>I topped my meals with fresh greens and cooked spinach.</li>
                                <li>My daily diet included tomatoes, broccoli, apples, oranges, grapefruits, bananas.
                                </li>
                                <li>I ate oatmeal in the mornings.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><img src="gerls/eat.JPG" alt="Image" class="aligncenter"></p>
                            <p>
                                But as you can guess, the result was almost self-defeating. To put it more correctly, I
                                lost 11 lbs over a month, but this only made matters worse, since my wrinkles became
                                even more visible.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                One evening, feeling rather desperate I registered at a females’ discussion board,told
                                my story and finished it by asking:
                            </p>
                            <blockquote>
                                I have tried everything, so should I just let this ride and stop looking after myself?
                            </blockquote>
                            <p>
                                I received a bunch of responses, calming and supportive. Many women wrote that hyped
                                beauty products didn’t really help remove eyebags and fine lines. They said that at
                                least I was lucky that the cosmetics didn’t do any harm to me. Investing big bucks in
                                advertising and design, many manufacturers cut costs at the expense of their products
                                quality and as the result we get a hokey-pokey that is really overpriced. But what is
                                more - it turns out that more than half of pharmacy and beauty products sold through
                                distribution contain hormones in the composition and thus they are addictive. That is,
                                while you are using them, you can observe some effect, but when you stop, everything
                                gets worse than it was.
                            </p>

                                One of the girls from the forum advised me an
                                <script>window.template('eye_care_cream')</script>
                                . I ordered it via the official
                                website. Since I decided to take no chances, I bought only one item - it was rather
                                inexpensive, only
                                <script>window.template('price')</script>
                                .
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I’d say that I fell in love with this cream at first sight ... at first sight of my
                                reflection in the mirror. The skin under my eyes became lighter and more elastic, the
                                black circles disappeared and my wrinkles became less noticeable. And this was just
                                after the first application! I felt completely satisfied with
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                and I would not
                                trade it for the world. As soon as I saw the effect, I immediately ordered a package
                                intended for using during a full month.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                is easily applied under the eyes and it vanishes in a few seconds, so I can
                                put my make up and get ready for work without a hitch. But frankly speaking, even if the
                                cream wasn’t that vanishing, I would get up half an hour earlier to apply it – it
                                produces such an effect that it is worth suffering some small inconvenience.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                After about a week of using
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                , I regained my self-confidence, since I was
                                thrilled with what I saw in the mirror: no dark circles, bags and lines under my eyes.
                                Girls in our legal department bombarded me with questions, while our men rained
                                compliments upon me. The female part of the team couldn’t believe that I didn’t undergo
                                any plastic surgery and even my mom had some doubts. But I managed to convince them by
                                ordering a couple of extra tubes of
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                – I gave one to my mom and presented
                                others to my friends.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Once I had to go to our head office in NY on a business trip. There was a very important
                                meeting with one of our major partners. When I entered a conference room, he was so
                                impressed that he could hardly answer my greetings. We held the meeting and then went to
                                a restaurant where we spent time talking as if I had known him all my life. Now, we are
                                a couple, and I am divorced from my husband - I don’t need a man who thinks that
                                wrinkles under his wife’s eyes are an acceptable excuse for spending nights away from
                                home.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                By the way, at first André (that's the name of my current husband) couldn’t believe that
                                I was well over 30 and I had to show him my driver’s license to prove my age. He thought
                                that I was something under 24 and now he always pokes fun at me saying that I need to
                                have my driver’s license with me if I want to be allowed to a bar to drink cocktails
                                with friends.
                            </p>
                            <p><img src="gerls/y_356c7134.jpg" alt="Image" class="aligncenter"></p>
                            <p>
                                So, ladies, I’d say that you hold the keys to the kingdom. We are the best, but we need
                                to take care of our beauty – through using available, certified and effective products
                                rather than through plastic surgery or Botox injections.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                You can actually see the effect – it looks like I got a facelift. But I didn’t and that
                                is just the point. This is all thanks to colloidal gold and I think we should be
                                grateful to scientists, who work constantly developing new products for us to look
                                younger. I continue using
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                , but mostly as an anti-aging product.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                As I have said, it is easy to use and you can find the instruction on the tube. Just
                                apply it under your eyes and it will do the rest. I almost forgot about another
                                important thing -
                                <script>window.template('product')</script>
                                is hypoallergenic, it contains no perfumes or parabens.
                                Besides, it can be used even in young girls.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                We all want to stay beautiful at any age. An attractive and pampered woman is
                                self-reliant and everything is smooth sailing for her, while she is inspired by men’s
                                compliments and admiring glances.
                            </p>

                                            I'm a little younger than Haley, but I had bigger problems. I work a lot and
                                            sleep 4-5 hours a day. As the result, I got dull skin, bags and black
                                            circles under the eyes and those disgusting wrinkles. But this cream is an
                                            absolute miracle. The know what's what when it comes to cosmetics.

                                            <script>window.template('name')</script> is something unbelievable! I have never purchased anything like
                                            this before, so there's nothing to compare with. But I really liked this
                                            cream. It makes my eyes shine, so it is the best thing to use when getting
                                            ready for a date.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            I think I'll put my two cents in. I ordered <script>window.template('product')</script> from an expensive
                                            online store of cosmetics. There, it costs two times as much as on
                                            the official site. Anyway, it was worth buying. I received it just in the
                                            beginning of December, when I was pressed with work, quarterly and annual
                                            reports, and then we had all those Christmas parties and school
                                            performances- and still I looked like after a two-week vacation in Hawaii.
                                            It is a terrific product!

                                                    other sites. Why to pay more? Moreover, it is really original cream
                                                    there, but how could you know about other sites?!</p>

                                            I am 51 years old. A natural type of aging, overweight, constant lack of
                                            sleep, nervous work (I run my own business) - everything but the kitchen
                                            sink. I certainly could afford (and I did) expensive cosmetics, but saw no
                                            effect. <script>window.template('name')</script> is a real catch for me. The result is simply staggering.
                                            Over many years, it is only now that I began to enjoy how I look.
